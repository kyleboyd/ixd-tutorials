# IxD:	Say Hiya to Markdown

By Dr. Kyle Boyd

## What is Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web and an easy way to write HTML.  Its pretty awesome.  You can control the display of a document by formatting words with bold or italics, create headings, make lists, add links and images. These are just a few things we can do in Markdown. Mostly this all can be done by throwing in some funky characters like `#` or `*`.

Come on and I will show you.

### Plain text

Good ole plain text comes together like this.

<pre>Its very easy to make text **bold** and *italics* in Markdown.</pre>

### Headers

Headers look like this.

<pre>
# This is a h1
## This is a h2
### This is a h3
#### This is h4
##### This is a h5
###### This is a h6
</pre>

# This is a h1
## This is a h2
### This is a h3
#### This is h4
##### This is a h5
###### This is a h6

###Emphasis

Emphasis can be completed in a few ways.

<pre>*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_</pre>

<pre>**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__</pre>

<pre>_You **can** combine them_</pre>

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

###Lists
Get it together with a good listomatic in Markdown.

#### Ordered

  <pre>1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
	 	1.  Item 2a
		2. Item 2b
3. Item 3</pre>

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
	1.  Item 2a
	2. Item 2b
3. Item 3

---


#### Unordered
<pre>+ Item 1
+ Item 2
	+ Item 2.1
	+ Item 2.1
+ Item 3</pre>

+ Item 1
+ Item 2
	+ Item 2.1
	+ Item 2.1
+ Item 3

### Links

The back bone of the web.  Simple in Markdown.

<pre>This is a look to google.  [Click Here.](http://www.google.com)</pre>

### Images 

We love a good image. Even in Markdown.

<pre>![Website Logo](/images/logo.png)</pre>

### Blockquotes

To make ourselves look smart.  Use blockquotes.

<pre>As John F Kennedy said:
> We must use time as a tool, not as a couch. </pre>

> We must use time as a tool, not as a couch.

### Tables 

We use tables but not for layout of course - that would be a crime against humanity.  Still useful for data.  

This is a table showing how many apples and oranges Mavis, Daisy and Sally had.  RocknRoll.



<pre>
Name | Apples | Oranges
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Mavis | Three | Two
Daisy | One | Four
Mavis | Four | Two
</pre>



Name | Apples | Oranges
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Mavis | Three | Two
Daisy | One | Four
Mavis | Four | Two
